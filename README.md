# ThreadlessOps - Enhanced Shellcoding for Threadless Injections

**ThreadlessOps** is a project demonstrating advanced process injection techniques with custom shellcode. While the initial focus is on **threadless injection**, this project goes beyond that by exploring enhanced shellcode crafting.


**Threadless Injection** is a stealthy method that avoids creating new threads by hijacking existing execution contexts within a target process. This reduces the likelihood of detection but requires more complex shellcode.

However, ThreadlessOps is not limited to threadless execution alone. In practice, we reintroduce thread creation to increase compatibility with various payloads.
